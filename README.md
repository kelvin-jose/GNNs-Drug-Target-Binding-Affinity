# GNNs-Drug-Target-Binding-Affinity

### Project Goal
Build a robust geometric GNN that predicts binding affinity from <b>protein-ligand</b> 3D complexes, and demonstrate imporved accuracy and interpretability vs classical docking and standard 2D GNN baselines. 

#### Phase 0
- Create a repo skeleton
- Setup environment management
- Version control with git
- Establish experiment tracking
